# Active_Learning_Protein_Protein_Interaction_Predictions

This work is inspired from the papers : 
1. Protein-protein interaction and non-interaction predictions using gene sequence natural vector. We have utilised their M.musculus_Constructed_RFInput file for this work.
2. Active learning for human protein-protein interaction prediction.

Objective:
The detailed information is on document named Progress Report.
