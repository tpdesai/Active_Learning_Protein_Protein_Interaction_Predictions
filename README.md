# Active_Learning_Protein_Protein_Interaction_Predictions

This work is inspired from the papers : 
1. Protein-protein interaction and non-interaction predictions using gene sequence natural vector. We have utilised their M.musculus_Constructed_RFInput file for this work.
2. Active learning for human protein-protein interaction prediction.

Objective:
Four Active Learning Methods namely, Mutual Information, Margin Sampling, Margin Sampling Positive and Density-Based Sampling was compared with Random Sampling to improve the model trained with Random Forest to improve predictions for protein-protein interactions and non-interactions.
